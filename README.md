# quantum

This project is dedicated to exploring and implementing quantum algorithms using [Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides), an open-source quantum computing framework.

## Overview

This repository will serve as a collection of quantum algorithms, ranging from foundational concepts to advanced implementations. The goal is to provide a hands-on approach to learning quantum computing and experimenting with Qiskit.

## Features

- Implementation of quantum algorithms such as:
    - Simple Quantum Teleportation
    - Grover's Search Algorithm # TODO
    - Shor's Algorithm # TODO
    - Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) # TODO
- Explanations for each algorithm #TODO
- Simulations and results using Qiskit Aer #TODO
- Support for running on IBM Quantum hardware #TODO

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.11 or later
- Qiskit
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

## Usage

1. Explore the `algorithms/` directory for implementations.
2. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/`.
3. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.
